### Answers

My answers to the challenges can be found within the "challenges' directory as a Node.js app. Navigate to the directory, run 'npm start', and open a browser to 'http://localhost:3000/' to view!

If that's not working, I also uploaded everything to Heroku [here] (https://ign-code-foo-2015-submission.herokuapp.com).
